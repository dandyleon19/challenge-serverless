### Swagger Test

To test in Swagger, you must first have run the following commands

- `sls deploy`

After that, you need to go to the link provided in the terminal, for example:

- `https://yourApiEdnpoint/dev/challenge-serverless`


### Test offline

To start a server locally, run de commands:

- `sls dynamodb install`
- `sls offline start`

You can test in Postman with the following endpoints:

- From `DynamoDB`:

```
# Get all people from dynamodb:

/GET http://localhost:3000/dev/people
```
```
# Create person from dynamodb:

/POST http://localhost:3000/dev/people
